A legally binding contract is formed on the date we send you confirmation of your order with your subscription account number and payment has been taken.</p>
			<p>You will receive this confirmation within 14 days by post, or by email within 72 hours if you supplied an email address. We will not be responsible if you fail to receive the written confirmation because you have supplied us with an incorrect postal address.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right not to accept or process your order for any reason. All orders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by your payment card issuer. If we do not accept your order and your credit/debit card has already been debited, we will notify you and refund your card in full immediately.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>where the issuer of your payment card refuses to authorise payment to us;</li>
				<li>where such delay or failure is due to circumstances beyond our control or the control of our sub–contractors and agents, including but not restricted to war, electricity power failure, utilities failure, failure of telecommunications links, failure of transport infrastructure, fire, flood, government act, act of God, legislative constraints, strikes, labour disputes or malicious damage involving employees.</li>

			<p>Prices displayed on the subscriptions section of the website will prevail at all times in relation to orders placed on-line. Prices quoted on screen include delivery charges and taxes (where applicable) and state the payment method. If you make ongoing Direct Debit payments or continuous credit card payments we reserve the right to increase our prices at any time after the first year of your subscription has elapsed and will notify you in writing with 10 days notice of any such price increase. Although we try to ensure that all prices are accurate, errors may occur. If we discover an error in the price of your order, we will inform you as soon as possible. You will have the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, we will treat the order as cancelled. We will refund you in full if you cancel the order and have already paid.</p>
			<h6>Credit Card Payment</h6>
			<p>If you are under 18 or are not using your own credit/debit card to pay for the subscription, you must ask the permission of the credit/debit card holder before entering the payment details. By clicking "Submit" you are confirming that you have obtained the express prior permission of the credit/debit card holder.</p>
			<h6>Liability</h6>
			<p>Our liability to you in the event of magazines being lost in despatch shall at our discretion, be limited either to replacement of the missing issues or refund of the cost of the missing issues.</p>

			<h6>Unauthorised access to personal information</h6>
			<p>Unless a member of our staff has been fraudulent or negligent, we will not be liable to you for any losses you may suffer as a result of unauthorised access by a third party to the information (including in particular credit/debit card details) you transmit when you place an order.

Occasionally some subscriber copies may be sent with covermounts and supplements included, however this is the exception rather than the rule.

			<p>Magazines delivered to overseas addresses shall not contain covermount gifts or supplements.</p>
