A legally binding contract is formed on the date we send you confirmation of your order with your subscription account number and payment has been taken.</p>
			<p>You will receive this confirmation within 14 days by post, or by email within 72 hours if you supplied an email address. We will not be responsible if you fail to receive the written confirmation because you have supplied us with an incorrect postal address.</p>
			<p>We reserve the right not to accept or process your order for any reason. All orders are subject to validation checks and authorisation by your payment card issuer. If we do not accept your order and your credit/debit card has already been debited, we will notify you and refund your card in full immediately.</p>

			<ul>

Prices quoted on screen include delivery charges and taxes (where applicable) and state the payment method. If you make ongoing Direct Debit payments or continuous credit card payments we reserve the right to increase our prices at any time after the first year of your subscription has elapsed and will notify you in writing with 10 days notice of any such price increase.

You will have the option of reconfirming your order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact you, we will treat the order as cancelled. We will refund you in full if you cancel the order and have already paid.</p>
			<h6>Credit Card Payment</h6>
			<p>If you are under 18 or are not using your own credit/debit card to pay for the subscription, you must ask the permission of the credit/debit card holder before entering the payment details. By clicking "Submit" you are confirming that you have obtained the express prior permission of the credit/debit card holder.</p>
